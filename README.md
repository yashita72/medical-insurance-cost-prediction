# Medical Insurance Price Prediction 💉📊

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using **Multiple Linear Regression**.  
The aim is to understand how various factors influence insurance costs and apply regression concepts to a real-world dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To predict medical insurance charges based on attributes such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
